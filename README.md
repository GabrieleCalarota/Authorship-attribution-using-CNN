# Authorship Attribution using CNNs ( Under Construction )
Given a set of documents by certain authors, correctly identify their authors using CNNs.

# Project Idea
I am going to be working on text classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Main Idea of my project is to classify blogs, given a set of blogs by a certain author correctly classify it. I am also going to compare it to some state of the art Machine Learning methods for authorship attribution.

# Dataset
The dataset to be used in this project is called Blogger dataset. The collected posts are from 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. I am downloading corpus from (http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm). According to this source "The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person.  

Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the bloggerâ€™s self-provided gender, age, industry and astrological sign. (All are labeled for gender and age but for many, industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.)

All bloggers included in the corpus fall into one of three age groups:

        8240 "10s" blogs (ages 13-17)

        8086 "20s" blogs(ages 23-27)

        2994 "30s" blogs (ages 33-47)

For each age group there are an equal number of male and female bloggers.   

Each blog in the corpus includes at least 200 occurrences of common English words. All formatting has been stripped with two exceptions. Individual posts within a single blogger are separated by the date of the following post and links within a post are denoted by the label urllink." 
This corpus is provided by http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~schlerj/schler_springsymp06.pdf.

# Software
I am going to use python Keras (https://keras.io/) for development of this deep learning model. Other tentative libraries that i could use include Spacy, Pandas, nltk (for preprocessing), numpy e.t.c

# Literature Review
For literature review, i am going to take a look at the following research papers

# Progress Milestones

# Design of Pipeline           ( October 20th )
I use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier with word embeddings for authorship attribution. More specifically, each word is mapped to a continuous-valued word vector using Word2Vec. Each input document is represented as a concatenation of word embeddings where each word embedding corresponds to a word in original document. The CNN model is trained using these document representations as input for authorship attribution. Then I train the multi-channel CNN consisting of a static word embedding channel (word vectors trained by Word2Vec) and a non-static word embedding channel (word vectors trained initially by Word2Vec then updated during training).

# Implementation               ( October 28th )
I have used the keras library for implementing the above mentioned pipeline. The code is attached above.

# Get Partial Results          ( Novermebr 4th )
Following table summarizes the results for 5 authors setting in blogs dataset. It shows that the our CNN method outperforms the traditional Machine Learning methods. A 5 Author setting is applying authorship attribution classifier on 5 authors from blogs dataset which have 100 articles each and are selected according to the average number of characters per artcile. These 5 are the ones with highest averages. The following table reports the classification accuracies.

|Setting   |Wrtiperints Static + SVM   |Basic-9 + FFNN   | CNN Method   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Blogs 5-Authors   |87%   |67%   |95%   |

# Complete Report with Results (December 1st)
Applying this method on 10 Authors setting.

The code used in this method is an implementation of CNN-Word-Word model from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06686
